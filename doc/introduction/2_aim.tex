\section{Aim of the project}

The aim of this project is to serve as a Proof of Concept on how MRI brain images can be artificially generated with Variational Autoencoders which ultimately would serve to enhance existing or new datasets to improve model accuracy by having larger samples of data.

Foreseen projects objectives are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Obtain basic knowledge about MRI images and the NIFTI file format
    \item Obtain and visualise 2-D images from 3-D images in the dataset
    \item Select what range of slices (2-D images) from brain to be created
    \item Test different existing networks and choose the one to be used
    \item Tune network parameters
    \item Compare generated brain images against real ones, qualitatively
\end{itemize}
