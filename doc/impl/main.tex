\chapter{Project Design and Implementation}

\section{Overview}
\label{sec:imploverview}
In this chapter the Design and Implementation tasks are described. They are Phases 1 and 2 of the project plan \ref{fig:project-plan} which suffered from some minor deviations and changes mainly after implementing the first VAE model.

In the following sections 2 different VAE implementations will be shown and discussed along with different encoders and decoders architectures which we will be referring to as the network architectures. Before that, the MR Images dataset and NIFTI protocol anayisis is explained with deepest detail on MR Images comprehension and preprocessing.

One key aspect is that in this project there is no validation option for the implemented models rather than the visual analysis of the created images which means that there will be no comparing tables or scorings along this chapter to reflect the quality of the model. However, some  training loss data will be used as the reference to partially demonstrate the quality of the different trained models of the different architectures and parameters.   

Project implementation consists of TensorFlow Notebooks executed in Google Colabs with standard GPU resources. The source code is stored at GitHub in \href{https://github.com/mtablado/uoc2022_tfm}{mtablado/uoc2022\_tfm} repository which is of public access while IXI dataset and pre-processed images are stored at Google Drive.

The Figure \ref{fig:environment} shows a diagram with the toolset and how they interact.

The project consists of 3 notebooks:

\begin{itemize}
    \item MRI which reads, processes and stores IXI images
    \item VAE which implements VAE model which uses pre-processed images
    \item VQ-VAE which implements VQ-VAE model which uses pre-processed images
\end{itemize}
