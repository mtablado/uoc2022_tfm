\section{Overview}

Since the project is based on brain anomaly detection with variational autoenconders (VAEs), in this section, the state of the art will be described with focus on previous existing anomaly detection projects and variational autoencoders.

Anomaly detection with VAEs has been used in several areas such as fraud detection, \Gls{kpi}s in web applications and, of course, MRI-based brain diagnosis.

In this section, the state of the art is covered by describing VAEs and MRI datasets first, and describing the related works later.
